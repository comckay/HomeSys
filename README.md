HomeSys
==================
The HomeSys project is an attempt at creating a fully open, data-driven "smart home." One that not only learns and adapts to the user, like other smart home systems, but also makes the data the user creates about themselves available outside of proprietary apps, environments, or file types. This project is a composite of open-source projects and personal fiddling.

This project uses the Arduino Yun to measure temperature and light level data & store it within a Google Docs spreadsheet using the web service Temboo.
